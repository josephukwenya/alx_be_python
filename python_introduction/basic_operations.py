# Instructions:

# Create a file named basic_operations.py.
# In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
# You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
# Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
# Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].

# Initializing my variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Performing calculations
addition_result = number1 + number2
substraction_result = number1 - number2
multiplication_result = number1 * number2

# Printing results
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {addition_result}")
print(f"Substraction of {number1} and {number2} is {substraction_result}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {multiplication_result}")
